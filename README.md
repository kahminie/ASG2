This website helps hungry users look for the nearest place where they can fill their tummies! Coffee Shops, Food Courts or even Cafe, Fastfood and Restaurants.

## Design Process
This website is targeted at users aged 14 and above. It is a simple navigating app that allows them to search for where they want to eat and how to get there.
As a user, I am hungry and would like to search for the nearest place where I can eat, so that I can quickly fill up my empty stomach.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
